     the RecursiveDirectoryIterator is only the container. You can iterate over it straight away (e.g. with foreach), but that linear order object iteration would not do the tree traversal.

     So the RecursiveIteratorItertor is providing object traversal in linear order while performing a tree traversal over a concrete RecursiveIterator implementaion.

     RecursiveIteratorIterator allows you to loop over a tree, IteratorIterator allows you to loop over a list.

     RecursiveIteratorIterator is a concrete Iterator implementing tree traversal.(树的遍历)

     IteratorIterator which is a concrete Iterator implementing object traversal in linear order (and by default accepting any kind of Traversable in its constructor)

     To summarize: RecursiveIterator is a concrete type of iteration (looping over a tree) that works on its own iterators, namely RecursiveIterator. That is the same underlying principle as with IteratorIterator, but the type of iteration is different (linear order).
